<h2> <em>Hello there ! Welcome to my personal site</h2></em>

<p> I have made this website to share my life story until now. </p>
<ul>
<p> <li><strong>1989 : Born in New Delhi on 27th May, India </strong></li>
	I have a wonderful family, blessed with amazing parents and awesome siblings who happen to be twins :) 
	<li><strong>1990-1992 : Doing nothing much but going to kindergarten and playing </li></strong>
Like any normal kid, do not recall much from this period but being the eldest kid had a lot of attention at home. I do remember playing a lot with my toys and always trying to hang around with my mother. </li> 
	<li><strong>1993-2007 : Basic Education aka Brainwashing </strong></li>
		Went to school in Birla Vidya Niketan, New Delhi where I invested the 14 years of my life to learn basic knowledge. I do agree that the knowledge gained was essential but definitely not enough to survive and understand the complexities of the world we live in now.
	<li><strong>2007-2011 : Bachelors of Engineering</strong></li>
	Well, as for any Indian kid, we didn't have much options in our careers back in 2007. It was either being a doctor or engineer, and given that my father is an engineer, the choice became quite easy ðŸ˜‚, so I ended up going to Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal. Haha, yes the MIT of India! Well, jokes apart, the CEO of Microsoft is my college Alumni so they must be doing something right! Graduated with an engineering degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2011 and actually didn't quite feel to move into the job world.
	<li><strong>2011: End of Bachelors. Job or No Job </strong></li>
		Graduated with an engineering degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2011 and actually didn't quite feel to move into the job world.
		As it happened, I came from an internship to Paderborn, Germany in Heinz Nixdorf Institute for 2 months in 2010. Having been impressed with the German way of living, plus other reasons (which I can talk about later), decided to pursue Masters in Germany.
	<li><strong>2011-2013: Masters in Communications Engineering, TU  Munich </strong> </li>
		After getting calls from TUHH, TU Stuttgart, TU Munich, I decided to go for Munich, given that Munich is definitely the better city from all of them. Ok, people from Hamburg and Stuttgart, we know your cities are cool too but nothing like Munich  ðŸ˜‹
		So, 2011-2013 went for me in pursuing my Master's. Ok, let me confess, that was not the only thing which happened during those two years. It was a new country, new people, new food, new culture. The first 6 months were a struggle, the weather was ðŸ¥¶and sometimes I really did not understand what was happening in courses. The jugglery between university, language, navigating your daily life was nonetheless a wonderful learning experience. It helped me evolve, to probably learn more in these two years than in the last 20 years of my life. It was October 2013, when I graduated with a Master's in Communications Engineering, and again at the point in my life, where I didn't feel like going into the job sector ðŸ™ƒ
		<li> <strong>2014-2020: Doctoral Research at TU Munich </strong><li>
			So there I was, with one of the humblest professors I have come across. I had met Prof. Norbert Hanik in his course. At the time, the only thing which was making sense to me was actually Optical Communication Systems, so I joined his course. Who knew, that one lecture decided the course of my life for the next 6 years. I eventually started my doctoral research work with him. I swear to God, when I first read the research topic, I had absolutely no clue what they were asking for.

			The initial years of my research were challenging. They kept me heavily engaged in researching for a solution to a problem. 

			Things eventually work out and the research led to several publications which can be found  <a href="https://scholar.google.pt/citations?user=k7X8nPkAAAAJ&hl=en"> here</a>
			<br>
		<li> <strong> March 2020 </strong> : Yoga teacher training in Rishikesh </li> 
		I wanted a break after a long stint with the research career and wanted to ponder over life in general, so here I was, trying to rekindle my lost interest in yoga and in February 2020, yes right before the pandemic hit, went to Rishikesh for a 200 hour yoga teacher training course. While I had been doing yoga on and off for the previous year, the immersive month in Rishikesh helped me to really appreciate the various practices in different areas of my life. I am a beginner practitioner of Ashtanga noe and try to do Ashtanga practice atleast 4 times a day. Wanna know more about my practice and classes ? Check out  <a href="" > here </a>
